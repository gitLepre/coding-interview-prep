## Tips
- Start with return statement
- Put down some comments before start coding
- What if I start sorting the input?
- What if I store data in a hash table?
- Give an example of input and output to make sure I understand the problem


## Solution steps
1. Give an example of input and output to make sure I understand the problem
1. Ask about contraints (edge cases, time complexity if needed, space complexity if needed) 
2. Ask about case with no input
3. Start with return statement
4. ...
